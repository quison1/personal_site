## Easy sausage carbonara
Serve 1.

### Ingredients
  - 150 g dried tagliatelle
  - 3 higher-welfare sausages
  -	1/2 a bunch of fresh flat-leaf parsley (15g)
  -	1 large free-range egg
  -	30 g Parmesan cheese

### Method
1. Cook the pasta in a pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions, then drain, reserving a mugful of cooking water. Meanwhile, squeeze the sausage meat out of the skins, then, with wet hands, quickly shape into 18 even-sized balls. Roll and coat them in black pepper, then cook in a non- stick frying pan on a medium heat with 1/2 a tablespoon of olive oil until golden and cooked through, tossing regularly, then turn the heat off.

2. Finely chop the parsley, stalks and all, beat it with the egg and a splash of pasta cooking water, then finely grate and mix in most of the Parmesan.

3. Toss the drained pasta into the sausage pan, pour in the egg mixture, and toss for 1 minute off the heat (the egg will gently cook in the residual heat). Loosen with a good splash of reserved cooking water, season to perfection with sea salt and pepper, and finely grate over the remaining Parmesan.

## Three cup chicken

<!-- ```{r, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'} -->
<!-- include_graphics("images//threecupchicken.jpg") -->
<!-- ``` -->

### Ingredients
  -	1 lb chicken drumsticks
  -	1 tablespoon baking soda, to tenderize the chicken, optional
  -	2 tablespoons dark sesame oil or toasted sesame oil
  -	2-inch piece old ginger, peeled and cut into thin pieces
  -	6 cloves garlic, peeled
  -	1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce
  -	1 1/2 tablespoons dark sweet soy sauce (kecap manis)
  -	1 1/2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine
  -	A big bunch Thai basil leaves

### Method
1. Cut the chicken into pieces and rub them with the baking soda. Set aside for 10 minutes before rinsing the chicken off with water. Make sure the baking soda is completely rinsed off. Pat dry the chicken pieces and set aside.

2. Heat up a claypot on high heat and add the dark sesame oil. Add the ginger, garlic, and stir-fry until aromatic. Add in the chicken and do a few quick stirs. Add the soy sauce, dark sweet soy sauce, Shaoxing wine and continue to stir-fry the chicken. Cover the chicken and lower the heat and simmer for 5-10 minutes. Add the basil leaves and stir well with the chicken, dish out and serve immediately.

### Cook's Notes
1. This recipe calls for dark sesame oil or toasted sesame oil, which is different from regular sesame oil. Dark sesame oil is a lot more expensive but the flavor is more intense and with a stronger toasted sesame fragrance.
2. 	You can skip the first step of tenderizing the chicken with baking soda. I personally like it because it makes the chicken so tender.
3. If you donâ€™t have a claypot, you can use a regular wok or pan to make this dish.

## Bok Choy chicken


### Ingredients
  -	6 oz boneless and skinless chicken breast, cut into thin pieces
  -	2 tablespoons oil
  -	8 oz bok choy, sliced into pieces
  -	1 inch piece ginger, peeled and sliced into pieces

### Marinade
  -	1/2 tablespoon soy sauce
  -	1/2 tablespoon cornstarch

### Sauce
  -	1/2 heaping tablespoon oyster sauce
  -	2 tablespoons water
  -	1/4 teaspoon sesame oil
  -	3 dashes white pepper
  -	1 teaspoon wine
  -	1/2 teaspoon sugar


### Method
1. Marinate the chicken with the ingredients in Marinade for 10 minutes. Combine all the ingredients in the Sauce in a small bowl, stir to blend well.
2. Heat 1/2 tablespoon oil in a wok until the oil becomes hot. Add the chicken and quickly stir-fry until the surface of the chicken turn opaque or white. Dish out and set aside. This step seals in the juice in the chicken so the texture is tender and velvety smooth.
3. Heat up the remaining oil in the wok until hot. Add the ginger into the wok and stir-fry until aromatic. Add the chicken back into the wok and do a few quick stirs. Add in the bok choy and stir to combine well. Transfer the sauce into the wok and continue to stir-fry until the bok choy is cooked but remain crisp. Do not overcook.
4. Dish out and serve immediately with steamed white rice.
